# US Census Analysis

### Application Deployment
The deployed model can be accessed **[here](https://us-census-analysis.herokuapp.com)**. Please note that the application expects a CSV file as input.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis can be found **[here](https://github.com/MiKueen/US-Census-Analysis/blob/main/data/acs2017_census_tract_data.csv)**. It provides valuable information for the US Census analysis.

To better understand the data fields and their descriptions, refer to the **[Data Dictionary](https://github.com/MiKueen/US-Census-Analysis/blob/main/data/data_dictionary.txt)**.

### Custom Input
If you would like to test the application with your own input files, you can find sample input files in the **[custom_input](https://github.com/MiKueen/US-Census-Analysis/tree/main/custom_input)** folder. Feel free to use these files as a reference or replace them with your own data.

### Jupyter Notebook
The comprehensive analysis, including exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and data modeling, is documented in the **[notebook](https://github.com/MiKueen/US-Census-Analysis/blob/main/notebook.ipynb)**. This notebook contains the complete code for the analysis and serves as a valuable resource for understanding the methodology.

### Flask App
To serve the model output based on the provided input file, a Flask app has been developed. You can find the source code for the app in the **[app.py](https://github.com/MiKueen/US-Census-Analysis/blob/main/app.py)** file. This app enhances the accessibility and usability of the analysis results.
